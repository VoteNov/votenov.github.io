# Prepare to be heard.

We are listening, building, and working on a way to improve the voter turnout for 2018. General elections are on November 6th, 2018 and there are state primaries between now and then. If you see errors, want to help update/add to @VoteNov, or think we could make this more accessible to people, please let us know.

## Voter primaries are here!

Many have passed, but there are plenty more coming per state. Go here and out if you have a voting / volunteering opportunity coming up.

- [2018 Primaries Calendar](http://votenov.com/2018-primaries).

## Follow VoteNov socially. 

Because this is currently being run by a single person, not much time will be dedicated to updating Twitter and or Instagram yet. When we have more people in place, we will make sure to get both major and minor messages out there.

## The VoteNov shop.

The [VoteNov Shop](http://shop.votenov.com/) is open for business! Get you PRE-VOTING stickers and buttons.

By showing off stickers, buttons, signs, bumper stickers, and maybe even fake tattoos, we will be sellings goods to help support your loud voice that shouts, “VOTE!” If you have any additional suggestions, please let us know.

## Call for designers.

The VoteNov design was purposely created as a blueprint in order to allow other individuals reimagine how the graphic should look. As a 4 letter by 4 letter grid, font, background, and the top four letter words waiting to be re-styled to fit your neighborhood, your crew, or a cause that is close to you. If you are interested in participating, please email us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Call for state page maintainers.

We are in the process of creating a state markdown template where a state local OR better yet, a group of locals that can gather all relevant voting information and share it out. We are not looking for partisan politics here, we are just looking to get people the most correct information in order to vote and support the vote. If you are intersted, please contact us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Who is behind this?
[@Shelton](http://www.twitter.com/shelton), and [@TheEmpathyLab](http://www.twitter.com/theempathylab) are currently steering this boat at the moment. So that we don't bring personal bias into this README, there is plenty more about the two elsewhere. Go check him and the Lab out.
