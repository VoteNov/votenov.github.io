## The VoteNov Shop.

The [VoteNov Shop](http://shop.votenov.com/) is open for business! Get you PRE-VOTING stickers and buttons.

By showing off stickers, buttons, signs, bumper stickers, and maybe even fake tattoos, we will be sellings goods to help support your loud voice that shouts, “VOTE!” If you have any additional suggestions, please let us know.

## Call for Designers.

The VoteNov design was purposely created as a blueprint in order to allow other individuals reimagine how the graphic should look. As a 4 letter by 4 letter grid, font, background, and the top four letter words waiting to be re-styled to fit your neighborhood, your crew, or a cause that is close to you. If you are interested in participating, please email us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.
