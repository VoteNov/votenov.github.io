# Be heard NOW

Between now and November 3, 2020, let's talk about voting, preparing to vote, helping other prepare to vote, and reminding each other that it is coming up very soon. Outside of the social and real life conversations, let's create some signs inviting others to vote with us. Here's your call to action.

Sticker and shirts coming soon.

## Call for state page maintainers.

We are in the process of creating a state markdown template where a state local OR better yet, a group of locals that can gather all relevant voting information and share it out. We are not looking for partisan politics here, we are just looking to get people the most correct information in order to vote and support the vote. If you are intersted, please contact us at <votenovember@gmail.com>.

## Register to vote.

If you are unsure of how to register to vote OR want to figure out where your polling place might be, here are some links that can help you start. If you have additional questions, please follow [VoteNov](https://twitter.com/VoteNov) on Twitter and DM us with your thoughts.

## Who is behind this?
@Shelton, and @TheEmpathyLab are currently steering this boat at the moment. So that we don't bring personal bias into this README, there is plenty more about the two elsewhere. Go check him and the Lab out.
